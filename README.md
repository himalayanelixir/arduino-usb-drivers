# Arduino USB Drivers

CH340 and CH341 USB controllers are commonly found on 3rd party Arduinos. To use them with the Arduino IDE or CLI you will need to install these drivers. The drivers in this repo are from the manufacturer (see [Sources](#Sources)).

To install them, download the repository and follow the instructions in the appropriate folder. If you have any previously installed versions of these drivers, uninstall them before installing the new drivers.

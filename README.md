## <a name='Summary'></a>Summary

The CH340 and CH341 USB controllers are commonly found on 3rd party Arduinos. To use them with the Arduino IDE or CLI you need to install extra drivers.

This repo contains the drivers for Linux, macOS, and Windows. Just download the repo and follow the instructions in the corresponding folder. If you have a previously installed a version of these USB drivers, you will likely need to uninstall them before installing the new driver.
